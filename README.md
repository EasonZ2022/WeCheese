# Team Roster

## Yicheng Zhang

Yicheng Zhang works on designing overall architecture of the game and implementing AR components. 
First, the MVC structure is proposed to structure the game and split responsibility: model layer for data storage, controller layer for handling game logic and communicating between machines, and view layer for rendering AR objects.
He works with Yuxuan in transplanting the hand landmark model from Mediapipe into Unity platform and rendering objects movement based on model output. 
A major challenge was the incompatibility between the WebCamera used for gesture recognition and the AR Camera used for the AR component. This issue was resolved by acquiring and manipulating textures obtained from AR Foundation on the CPU, thus eliminating the need for the WebCamera. Additionally, he handled the problem triggered by transformation between the viewport and the local coordinate systems, which was involved in the interaction between gesture recognition and AR chess pieces.


## Dier Hou

Dier Hou is responsible for setting up the connection between the front-end app and the back-end firebase database. First, I am responsible for setting up the user signup and login mechanism using Firebase Authentication. Second, I implemented the storage of each user's each game and every move in the Firebase Database. Finally, I realized the real-time synchronization of the two users' move in one game.

## Yuxuan Zhu

Yuxuan Zhu works on the machine learning part of this project, specifically, the hand gesture detection part. He deployed the hand landmark model and palm detection model from Mediapipe by Google. To integrate the models to unity engine, he transferred the tflite package to unity platform and implemented the model inference algorithm using C#. Alternatively, he designed a python version of the algorithm as a backup solution on the backend.

## Zhemin Qu

Zhemin Qu works on the abstract chess and chessboard structure at the front-end. More specifically, he applies the concept of interface in Object-Oriented-Programming to implement various different chesses, including pawns, bishops, cannons, etc., and various data structures to design and implement the abstract chessboard. He works on the movement validation, movement recording, and basic rules of the game.

Meanwhile, Zhemin works as the intermediate to communicate between the backend (Firebase Manager) and the frontend renderer. As the information stored in the back-end is significantly different from the information required in the AR renderer, and the data stored in the backend should be consistent, while the view of each player is different, one great challenge is to transform the data correctly and effectively.

# Model and Engine

## Story Map

## Block Diagram

![Engine_Architecture](/Engine_Architecture.jpg)

The project is mainly composed of the following three parts:

- **User End:** The user end is implemented with Unity. It is responsible for rendering AR settings and sending user requests (find opponents, move chess, retrieve previous games) to the server engine. It relies on the Unity AR Foundation library to render AR components and depends on OpenCV to process user gesture so as to determine user move.
- **Server Engine:** The server engine, implemented with Flask API, is responsible for processing user requests. It contains the following three handlers, you can refer to the [API and Controllers](#APIs and Controller) part for implementation details:
  * Match Request Handler: Processes user request for matching an opponent.
  * Game Sync Handler: Receives user moves and forwards the game progress to the opponent.
  * Progress Retrieval Handler: Processes user request for resuming unfinished game or saving game progress. It retrieves data from the database and sends to the user end.
- **Database**: The database, implemented in Firebase, stores user information and game progress.

## UI/UX Flow Overview

Tool: Figma
## User Test Video
Link:  https://sjtu.feishu.cn/file/InWAb4pVToxTsMxrGDlcjAupn8c
## Summary of Findings
**1.** Generally the UI is straightforward and easy to use.

**2.** Opponent move is not easy to tell.

**3.** Board selection interface is confusing, more prompts needed.

**4.** Board style and chess piece style selection should be separated.

**5.** Proper prompts should be given when game ends.

**6.** User feels confused about having to invite a friend again when resuming a game.
## Numerical Results
| Task | Evaluation Metrics | VChess (% success) |
| --- | --------  | ----------- |
| Initiate game by inviting friend. | <= 2 clicks | 83% |
| Change board style | <= 2 clicks |  50% |
| Make a move | <= 2 clicks |  100% |
| Watch opponent's move | <= 1 clicks, Identify move | 34% |
| Save the game | <= 2 clicks |  100% |
| Review game | <= 2 clicks |  83% |
| Resume game | <= 2 clicks |  100% |
| End game | <= 2 clicks |  100% |

## Final Design Justification
**Provide reminding for opponent move:** Change the prompt to 'Opponent move finished!'

**Provide prompts for board selection interface:** 
Showing the difference between two boards

**Provide prompts when game ends:**
A new page is added to the game process when someone wins, and there will be another new page for a lost

**Add login and signup page:**
Pages used for login and signup are added in order to transfer user data with backend

Shown above is the UI/UX flow overview. There are three main streams: starting new game, resuming game and reviewing a previous game. To start a new game, one user will be given a 6-digit number and another user can enter the code to join the game. This is to ensure that the two users can join the same game. After both users have joined the game, they will be directed to the game view and start making moves. To resume a game, both users will resume the latest game they started, the chess board will be updated to the latest status. To review a game, users can press the "next step" button to view the game step by step.
